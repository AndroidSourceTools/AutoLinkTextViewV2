    <string name="android_text">Android is a mobile operating system developed by https://google.com.
            It is based on a modified version of the @Linux kernel and other open source software,
            and is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile #devices such as smartphones and #tablets.
            \n\n In addition, https://google.com has developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars
            and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_OS for wearables, each with a specialized user #interface.
            Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and other #electronics.
            Android is also associated with a suite of proprietary software developed by Google,
            called Google Mobile Services (GMS),that frequently comes pre-installed on devices.
            This includes core apps such as Gmail chatikyana@gmail.com ,
            the application store/digital +37493023017 distribution platform Google @Play and associated Google Play Services development platform,
